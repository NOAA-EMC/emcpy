Introduction
============

EMCPy is a collection of Python tools and utilities developed within EMC. The vision for EMCPy was to develop a centralized repository to create a Python "toolkit" for both experienced and novice users.

The ultimate goal is to create these collection of tools into a Python package. The code leverages Object Oriented Programming (OOP), agile development, and includes thorough documentation for future developers.
