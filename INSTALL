Installation
============

To clone the most recent version of EMCPy from the develop branch, use the following on the command line::

    git clone https://github.com/noaa-emc/emcpy

To install EMCPy::

    cd emcpy
    pip install .
    
If working on Hera, there are firewalls that prevent the shapefiles needed to plot map projections to download from the internet. A workaround for this is to run the following script which links the shape files that are downloaded on Hera::

    sh /scratch1/NCEPDEV/da/Cory.R.Martin/Python/ln_cartopy.sh
